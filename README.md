# Car registration statistics

Ukraine has a lot of open data sources and one of them is vehicle registration data.
In this data, people can find information about all the vehicles that are officially registered and can be found on Ukrainian roads.
Examples:
- Number of vehicles
- Number of Brands
- Number of Diesel or electric cars
- Find information about a vehicle by its registration number (starting from 2013)
- etc
# Purpose

This registration data is big enough to build the app (for educational purposes) using the microservice approach and learn something new and polish existing knowledge.

# Stack

In order to build an application there are ideas to use the following stack/technologies:
- Java 11+
- Spring Framework (Spring boot)
- Typescript
- ReactJs (or any other web UI frameworks)
- Docker/Docker Compose
- Build Pipeline as Jenkins

# Other information

There were tries to build this functionality but because of the lack of time/ideas/knowledge, it was always postponed, making long pauses, etc.
As result - it will be another try, that should summarize all previous tries and create a working app.
